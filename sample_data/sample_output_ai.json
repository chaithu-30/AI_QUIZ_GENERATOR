  "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. AI research has been defined as the field devoted to building intelligent agents, systems that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chance of achieving their goals.",
